# RODI

You are welcome to join us on www.rodiproject.org ! You can check out the news about Rodi and meet the founders and Most Valuable Professionals
around the project. And if you're involved enough, you could be party of them !

First of all, this project is developped in order to be used with DotNetNuke. To use correctly RODI, you must download DotNetNuke. Then you have to copy the folder web where your DNN website has been created.

If you want a complete access to the code, you should buy an Aspose licence. We're using this library in the code so you won't be able to use modules which are using it.

For more informations, check the wiki on www.rodiproject.org. If you still have questions, feel free to ask in the forum!

Thank you for using RODI and making it better!
