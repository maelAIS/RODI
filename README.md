# RODI

First of all, this project is developped in order to be used with DotNetNuke. To use correctly RODI, you must download DotNetNuke. Then you have to copy the folder web where your DNN website has been created.

If you want a complete access to the code, you should buy an Aspose licence. We're using this library in the code so you won't be able to use modules which are using it.
